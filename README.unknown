"Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews"

Abstract
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task aimed at identifying and classifying the sentiment expressed in textual data. 
This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews to determine whether they convey positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
The process involves text preprocessing techniques such as cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization, followed by the development 
and evaluation of machine learning models for classification. 
The outcome of this project provides insights into customer opinions, aiding businesses in decision-making and improving customer satisfaction.

 Methodology

 1. Data Collection
- Source: The dataset is sourced from publicly available repositories like Kaggle or scraped from e-commerce websites.
- For this project, a sample dataset from a GitHub repository is used.

2. Data Preprocessing
Steps:
1. Cleaning the Text:
   - Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation.
   - Convert text to lowercase.
   - Remove stopwords (e.g., "is," "the," "and").
2. Tokenization:
   - Split the text into individual words or tokens.
3. Lemmatization:
   - Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" → "run").
4. Vectorization:
   - Convert textual data into numerical form using methods like:
     - Bag of Words (BoW)
     - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
     - Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT).

3. Model Development
Steps:
1. Train-Test Split:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
2. Model Selection:
   - Use classification algorithms such as:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
     - Naïve Bayes
     - Random Forest
     - Neural Networks (if using deep learning).
3. Model Training:
   - Train the model using the preprocessed data.

4. Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Visualize performance using a confusion matrix.

Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
2. Run the Code:
   Save the script in a Python file (e.g., `sentiment_analysis.py`) and execute it:
   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
   ```
3. Dataset:
   The script uses a sample dataset from a GitHub repository. Replace the URL in `load_data()` with your dataset path if necessary.

Outputs
- Performance Metrics:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Visualization:
  - Confusion Matrix showing the model's performance.

Results
The trained Logistic Regression model achieved high accuracy in identifying sentiment.
The confusion matrix visualized the classification performance across positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
